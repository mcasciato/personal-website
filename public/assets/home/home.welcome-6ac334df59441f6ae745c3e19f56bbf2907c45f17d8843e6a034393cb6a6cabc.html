      <p>I'm a full stack web developer after being a professional campus minister in a past life.</p>

      <p>
        <em>A campus minister turned coder?</em>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In a nutshell, yes. I loved ministry, but I needed a change. I needed a new challenge where I would be encouraged to try new things. I made the decision and dove head first into programming. It's been a challenging, but exciting journey so far, and I can't wait to see where it takes me!</p>
