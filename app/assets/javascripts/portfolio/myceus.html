<p><em>The go-to stop for healthcare professionals to log their continuing education units.</em></p>

<p>When I was tasked with building a <strong>Rails CRUD</strong> app, naturally I turned to my wife for ideas (as any wise husband would do). Being an Occuptational Therapist, my wife has to accumulate a certain number of continuning educatin units (CEUS) in order to maintain her license. She told me it would be nice to have an app to easily keep track of these. <strong>Boom!</strong> There was my idea!</p>

<p>Upon signing up, either manually or via <strong>Facebook (OmniAuth)</strong>, a user can log their CEUs, entering in all pertinent information for a CEU: <strong>Title</strong>, <strong>Date</strong>, <strong>Location</strong>, <strong>Duration</strong>, and <strong>Certification (State or National)</strong>.
</p>

<p>I later added <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>jQuery</strong> functionality to the app, specficially the following features:

    <div class="ui list">
      <div class="item">
        <div class="header">New CEU Creation</div>
        A CEU's information will appear in a separate <code>div</code> upon to creation to show that the data has been successfully persisted.
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <div class="header">Show All CEUs</div>
        On the user's landing page, all CEUs are hidden by default. Simply click a button to display the list.
      </div>
      <div class="item">
        <div class="header">Navigation between CEUs</div>
        Instead of having to navigate back to the list of all CEUs, a user can simply click a button to bring up the next CEU.
      </div>
    </div>

</p>
